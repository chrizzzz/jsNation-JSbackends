# What's your backend written with? JavaScript?!
Slides and sources for the talk about JavaScript backends given at [JSNation 2019](https://jsnation.com/)

When thinking of backend languages, JavaScript is not the first thing that comes to mind. But why not? Why not write a backend in JavaScript? Or even a whole microservices infrastructure!<br/>
In this talk we will discuss exactly what a microservice can look like in Javascript with the addition of frameworks like Socket.IO or NestJS and how several microservices would communicate with each other.<br/> 
There is no prior knowledge of JavaScript required. Everything we show will be explained.

#### NOTE: The slides are still a work in progress and have not yet been published.
